# e-plantShopping

## Paradise Nursery Shopping Application

**e-plantShopping** is a React and Redux–based shopping cart application built for the _Paradise Nursery_ online plant store. The application allows users to browse different categories of house plants, add items to a cart, manage quantities, and view total costs dynamically.

This project is the **Final Project** for the Paradise Nursery Shopping Application lab and demonstrates the use of modern React features and Redux Toolkit for global state management.
